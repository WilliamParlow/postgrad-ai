In the stillness of the night, so deep,  
Dreams awaken from their quiet sleep.  
Stars above in a velvet sky,  
Whisper secrets as they drift by.  

The moon casts shadows, soft and pale,  
Telling stories, an endless tale.  
A world of wonder, vast and wide,  
Where mysteries and hopes collide.  

Let the silence speak its tune,  
Beneath the watchful eye of the moon.  
For in the dark, a light does gleam,  
Guiding hearts through every dream.
